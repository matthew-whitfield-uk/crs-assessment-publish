## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Notes on functionality

While the core functionality has been implemented, a few areas could not be due to time constraints:

- **Superset sorting and filtering:** The superset of items should be sortable and filterable to help users find items more easily. 
  
- **Subset reordering (move up/down):** The subset of items should have the ability to reorder items (e.g., move items up or down). 

- **Testing and refactoring:** The application could benefit from a more comprehensive suite of tests, along with an associated refactor to improve maintainability.

Despite these limitations, the core logic and structure of the application are in place and can be extended to include these enhancements in the future.
